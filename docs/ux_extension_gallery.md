| **Extension Name**  | The name of your extension must clearly communicate what it does in one to three words. Use title case, making sure that each word starts with a capital letter. The name you use here must match the name you specified in the extension manifest file (`.trex`).|
| **Extension Icon**  | The icon for your extension will be displayed at a small size, so ensure that all the important visual elements of your icon are easily visible. Dimensions for the icon must be 280x280 pixels and uploaded as a `.png` file with transparency. Learn more about branding at [Branding your Extension]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/Style_Guidelines/ux_branding.html). Note that the icon you use here must look like the icon you include in the extension manifest file (`.trex`). The icon in the manifest file is used in the **About** dialog box for your extension. The icon in the manifest file is a 70x70 pixel `.png` file that is Base64 encoded.   |
| **Tagline**         | The tagline is one sentence that explains what the extension does. The maximum length is 96 characters. This tagline is also used within the extension configuration dialog. Learn more at [Extension Components and Modes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/Interaction_Guidelines/ux_components_modes.html).|

## How to Submit your Extension

After completing your extension, fill out the [Extension Gallery Submission form](https://tabsoft.co/gallerysubmit){:target="_blank"}{:ref="noopener"} with your information and extension details. The extension name in the template needs to match the name you specified for your extension in the manifest file (`.trex`). The 280x280 pixel `.png` icon that you attach with your submission must look like the icon you included in your manifest file (they just have different dimensions). Our developers from the Developer Platform team at Tableau will let you know the next steps including legal agreements after you submit. If you have any questions about the gallery please send them to [extensiongallery@tableau.com](extensiongallery@tableau.com){:target="_blank"}{:ref="noopener"}.
